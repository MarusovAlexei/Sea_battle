Sea battle

A game for two participants, in which the players take turns choosing
the coordinates on the opponent's unknown battlefield. If the opponent
has a ship at these coordinates (the coordinates are occupied), then
the ship or part of it is "killed", and the one who got it gets the right
to make one more move.

How to play:

1. We arrange the ships manually or we order an assistant to do it.
2. We choose the level of complexity of the computer with which we will play.
   (easy - cabin boy, medium - captain, difficult - admiral)
3. We make the first shot and the game has begun.
4. During the game, you can end the game by pressing the surrender button.
5. After the end of the game, you can start the game over.
